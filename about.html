            	<p>I’m an independent web developer living in Bandung, Indonesia. Currently I spend my days working as owner for <a href="http://www.kuninganedu.com" target="_blank">Kuningan Education</a>. I’m also available for smaller. I’m currently unavailable for projects, though feel free to get in touch if you have an idea I might be interested in.</p>

            	<p>I spend my days with my hands in many different areas of web development from back end programming (PHP, Ruby on Rails) to front end engineering (HTML, CSS, and jQuery/Javascript).</p>
